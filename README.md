# Nuxt V3 Project

## Run in Docker-compose

Make sure docker is running in your device.
Then run in the command line:

```bash
# docker
docker compose up
```

It will take 2 mins to build.

When there is a new image created and running, open the link in the browser:
```
localhost:5001
``` 

Now you can see the magical page :P
